Hi, I’m **Haowei**.  

I’m a learning experience designer passionate about creating meaningful, engaging educational experiences through thoughtfully designed technologies and instructional materials.  

With an interdisciplinary background spanning **education, psychology, interaction design, and marketing**, I explore innovative ways to transform how we learn and grow.  

My current work focuses on exploring **large language models (LLMs)** and leveraging their potential to spark curiosity, foster deeper understanding, and support lifelong learning.
