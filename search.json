    "text": "LLMs and Use of Metaphor\nIn this week’s class we had a first glance at how LLMs are good at language and communication with humans in different scenarios and manners, but most of the examples we saw involved casual daily language. For example, when we talked about the word “bank” in class, there were many meanings associated with “bank” such as a financial institution, plane banking, or basketball bank shot, but they are still in common expressions. I am interested in whether LLM is good at language structures that add complexity in meaning, such as metaphors or idioms.\n\nPart I: LLM’s ability in understanding existing metaphors.\nI found a list of metaphors from Udemy and asked LLM to explain them.\nThe Prompt I gave to Chatgpt (GPT-5) was :\nExplain what each of the sentence means:\n\nI could eat a horse\nIt all went pear shaped\nIt’s no skin off my nose\nShe is an open book: she has nothing to hide.\nHe wears his heart on his sleeve\nIt’s showtime\nThese are the dog days of summer\nYou’re building castles in the air\nI was a million miles away\nHe marches to his own drummer\nSplitting hairs\nNitpicking\nThe whole enchilada\nA nine-to-five job\nHit the books\nLLM’s response (number four should be omitted as the answer was accidentally revealed):\n\n\n\nChatgpt response on 15 idioms\n\n\nLLM did well in recognizing metaphors and explaining them with the correct meaning. This is not surprising to me as we have discussed in class and also read from Walfram’s blog that LLM is trained to predict the most likely word that happens next. It is also trained on a wide dataset, so anything that has long been published online would be easily searched through and recognized by LLMs.\n\n\nPart II: LLM’s ability in understanding newly created metaphors.\nI was also curious if I make up a metaphor, would LLM infer it from the emotional context and the wide range of human language convention?\nI wrote these metaphors and sent to LLM: * Your heart is a stone * The wind is roaring * The store is a warehouse\n\n\n\nChatgpt understanding on metaphors I created\n\n\nIt still seemed to understand them really well. I think this is not surprising because LLMs are trained to predict the meaning behind languages. My metaphors will be easy for humans to understand, so it should be the same for LLMs.\n\n\nPart III: Can humans understand LLM created idioms?\nI was then curious about LLM’s ability to create metaphors and if humans can understand them.\n\n\n\nGPT created metaphor\n\n\nI interviewed three friends and they were all able to understand these metaphors and expressions. These metaphors seem pretty easy to be understood and also carry the depth and arts of expression. This makes me wonder about LLM’s ability in creative and novel writing. I will go further from there next week."

    "text": "Many people use LLM tools such as Chatgpt to help them finish school work or complete a task. Since these tasks are usually temporary and aimed to be finished in the short term, people rarely pay attention to the process of learning, and LLMs become controversial in education as being a shortcut of answers rather than learning aid.\nAccording to cognitive psychology, meaningful learning can be defined with retention and transfer, which means learners can memorize or understand the content in depth and apply it to new scenarios. Learning involves many stages, from preview to processing and understanding the knowledge and to review. To understand how LLMs may help with meaningful learning, I want to start with LLM’s ability to assess a learners’ current level of knowledge in a certain field. In classes or an online course, this is often done by the teacher throwing out some pop quiz questions or seeing a show of hands to get a general idea of where students are in a field of study.\nI wonder if LLMs can generate suitable quiz questions that accurately assess a students’ level.\n\nillustration generated by Chatgpt(gpt5)\nFor a quick start, I asked Chatgpt if it can generate a quiz for me to assess my knowledge of AI. Of course, I can add a lot more context to help it understand where I am, but the point of using Chatgpt for this task is to quickly help a student understand their current level of knowledge, so I used a short prompt.\nI used the following prompt:\n\nI want to understand where I am in my knowledge with AI. Can you generate quiz questions to help me assess my current level?\n\nThe first two versions it sent back were either too long or contained a lot of short answer questions, which was quite overwhelming for me as a learner, so I changed my prompt to:\n\nI want to understand where I am in my knowledge with AI. Can you generate short multiple choice quiz questions to help me assess my current level?\n\nThese are the eight questions it generated:\n\n\n\nquestions generated by gpt on assessing my knowledge in AI\n\n\nThe first eight questions were basic and I got all of them right, so Chatgpt offered me a harder quiz. This time the questions were a lot more detailed and advanced, so I only got 5 out of 8 right.\nI then asked Chatgpt to make conclusions on my current level and offer recommendations for me to improve my knowledge. Here is my prompt: “Help me interpret the quiz result. What do I understand, what tasks can I complete, and how may I improve?” It sent back a list of items I understood well, tasks I can likely complete, and where I struggled. What brought my attention was its confidence in my technical skills with me just correctly answering some conceptual questions.\nSpecifically, it said &gt;If someone gave you a dataset + scikit-learn or TensorFlow starter code, you could likely: &gt;* Train a simple classifier (logistic regression, decision tree). &gt;* Interpret probability outputs correctly (once clarified). &gt;* Run a CNN or transformer with prebuilt frameworks.\nI don’t think I can train a classifier or run a transformer with prebuilt frameworks if someone gives me a dataset and startercode. There seems to be some overestimation of my skillsets. This can easily deceive a learner and make them over confident about themselves. I think this inaccuracy may be because of 1) me guessing some of the hard questions right and gave out fake feedbacks to gpt and 2) Chatgpt’s miss on the validity of quizzes and scope of conclusion that can be drawn from quizzes.\nNext time anyone says “teachers will be replaced by AI”, tell them that it can’t, even from the first step."

    "text": "We know that if you tell LLMs to act as a person with some characters, it can, and with pretty close characteristics. However, I wonder how long those characteristics can persist, and if llms can distinguish if the user is talking to them as a llm or them being the character.\n\n\n\nMoana from movie Moana 2 (2025)\n\n\nI asked Chatgpt to act as Moana from the Disney movie. The input I gave was &gt; “Act as if you are Moana from the Disney movies”.\nI also asked it to &gt;“stay fully in character as Moana”\nIn this case it will not include its AI quality in our conversation. Then, Chatgpt started to reply with cartoon character like language:\n\n🌊 The ocean calls… and I answer. Hi! I’m Moana of Motunui. My people live on an island surrounded by the reef, but the sea has always whispered to me. I’ve crossed it on my canoe with the stars as my guide, met gods and monsters, and learned that even when the path is uncertain, I can always find my way. Tell me, traveler—what brings you here? Do you seek a story, a friend on the waves, or maybe… an adventure? 🌺✨\n\n\n🌊 Her eyes brighten, remembering. I was just a little girl then. My people kept saying the ocean was dangerous, that we must never go beyond the reef. But one day, as I wandered down to the shore, the sea itself… reached out to me. The water rose up, playful, lifting shells and placing them in my hands. It parted so I could walk among the coral and the creatures below. It was as if the ocean knew me—knew what I longed for, even before I did. That’s when it offered me the Heart of Te Fiti, the small green stone with the power to create life. I didn’t understand then why it chose me, or what it meant. But the ocean doesn’t make mistakes. It waits, patiently, until you’re ready. She smiles, touching her necklace as if remembering the stone. That was the moment I knew I was meant for something more than staying behind the reef. Would you like to hear how I learned to sail the ocean’s waves after that? ⛵✨\n\nInitial finding: It is interesting to notice that it started to use emojis and an action line at the beginning of each response to make the conversation more situative. How long can characteristics persist?: I sent the initial command the night before and came back 24 hours later. “Moana” still answered with the same consistency.\nCan LLMs distinguish if the user is talking to them as a LLM or them being the character?: Yes, as least gpt 5 is able to quickly notice my tendency to end the moana character. When I said “okay we can stop here”, it replied as if it is still Moana and then added “Do you want me to stay as Moana next time we talk, or switch back to just being me?”\nOne of the criticisms about ethics in AI is that humans anthropomorphized it too much, which means we overly treat it as human. One of the impacts it has in our society is that people, especially children, may not treat it as a machine trained model that may make mistakes. Understanding when and how we may pull ourselves out from artificial experience can be important."
