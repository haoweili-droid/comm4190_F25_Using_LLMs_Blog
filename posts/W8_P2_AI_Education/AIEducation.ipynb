    "As a student in Learning Science and Technologies, I have had the chance to interact with several large language models as part of coursework, projects, and everyday studying. Among the most commonly used tools are GPT, Gemini, and Claude. While they are often discussed together as “AI chatbots,” each model reflects different design priorities that shape how they support learning. In this post, I compare these tools through an educational lens, focusing on how they align with learning science principles such as scaffolding, cognitive load, metacognition, and sensemaking."

    "## GPT: Structured Scaffolding and Task-Oriented Learning\n",
    "GPT is the tool I most often use for structured academic work. From a learning sciences perspective, GPT excels at scaffolding. When prompted carefully, it can break down complex concepts into step by step explanations, generate outlines, or model examples that resemble worked examples in instructional design. This is especially useful when learning unfamiliar theories or methods, such as cognitive load theory or experimental design.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT is also highly adaptable to different instructional roles. It can act as a tutor, a peer reviewer, or even a simulated instructor when asked to explain content at varying levels of difficulty. This flexibility supports zone of proximal development style learning, where the learner can request more or less support as needed. However, the same strength can become a weakness. Because GPT is very efficient at producing polished answers, it can reduce productive struggle if students rely on it too quickly. From a learning standpoint, this means GPT works best when used intentionally as a support tool rather than an answer generator."

    "## Gemini: Multimodal Reasoning and Exploratory Learning\n",
    "Gemini stands out most clearly in its integration with multimodal information. Because it is closely tied to Google’s ecosystem, Gemini is especially effective when tasks involve synthesizing information across text, images, tables, or web-based content. From a learning sciences perspective, this supports multimedia learning principles, where learners benefit from connecting verbal and visual representations.\n",
    "Gemini feels particularly useful for exploratory learning. When I use it to brainstorm research questions, compare sources, or connect ideas across domains, it encourages a more open-ended interaction. Instead of guiding me through a single correct path, Gemini often surfaces multiple perspectives or related concepts. This can support sensemaking and knowledge integration, which are important for higher-level learning.\n",
    "That said, Gemini’s exploratory nature sometimes comes at the cost of instructional clarity. Its responses can feel less structured than GPT’s, which may increase cognitive load for novice learners. In educational contexts, this means Gemini may be better suited for early ideation, synthesis, or inquiry-based learning rather than direct instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Claude: Reflection, Metacognition, and Writing Support\n",
    "Claude feels the most “human” in tone and interaction style, which has important implications for learning. It is particularly strong at reflective tasks, such as discussing reasoning processes, revising writing, or engaging in ethical or conceptual debates. From a learning sciences lens, Claude supports metacognition by making reasoning more explicit and by encouraging learners to think about why an answer works, not just what the answer is. In writing related tasks, Claude is effective as a thought partner rather than a solution provider. It often responds with nuance, caveats, and alternative interpretations, which mirrors how instructors might respond during office hours. This can be especially valuable in communication and social science courses where ambiguity and interpretation are part of the learning goal. However, Claude is sometimes less efficient for technical or highly structured tasks. When clear procedures or precise outputs are needed, its conversational style can feel indirect. This suggests that Claude is best positioned as a reflective companion rather than a procedural tutor."

    "## To Conclude:\n",
    "\n",
    "From a learning science perspective, GPT, Gemini, and Claude each support different learning processes. GPT is strongest for scaffolded instruction and structured academic tasks. Gemini supports multimodal exploration and synthesis across information sources. Claude excels at reflection, metacognition, and writing focused learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than asking which tool is best, a more productive question is how each tool can be aligned with specific learning goals. For students, this means choosing tools intentionally based on the type of thinking required. For educators, it suggests opportunities to design assignments that encourage appropriate AI use, such as reflective prompts with Claude, exploratory research with Gemini, or guided practice with GPT. Ultimately, these tools do not replace learning. They reshape how learning happens. Understanding their differences helps us use them not as shortcuts, but as cognitive partners that support deeper engagement with ideas.\n"
