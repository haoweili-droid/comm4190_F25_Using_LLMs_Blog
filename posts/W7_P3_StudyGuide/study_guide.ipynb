    "#  Creating a study guide based on quizzes? Turn shortcut to meaningful learning  \n",
    "There are many tools on the market that help teachers create assignments and assessments based on curriculum content. However, I am thinking the other way around. Can we create a tool that helps students to re-study a class based on their homework answers? \n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind this idea include two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) With LLMs, people sometimes rely on AI to get an answer instead of actually learning the content. That is understandable because AI is just so tempting, and when you are stressed out with all the schoolwork, it is common for someone to offload mental work to AI. The way to learn content (or not) totally depends on one’s own goal. However, what I am concerned about is: what if someone looks back from the assignment and wants to learn again? Is there a way to help them quickly on track with their original learning path?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Learning can be personalized and adaptive with AI. If students can upload their assignment to an AI and it offers targeted study plan, feedback, and review content, it will help provide more flexible learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "With these two ideas in mind, I experimented in LLMs and see whether I can prompt them to achieve the above functions. \n"

    "Overall, the AI-generated study guide generally supports the two ideas that motivated this project, though in a fairly expected and incremental way rather than a transformative one. The guide successfully shifts attention from quiz scores to underlying conceptual understanding by identifying specific misconceptions and organizing review content around them. This suggests that using completed quizzes as input can help students return to the original learning goals of the course, especially when they want to relearn material after an assignment is over. In this sense, the tool does help students get back on track without requiring them to reread everything or start from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output also aligns with the idea of using AI to support more personalized and adaptive learning. Instead of reviewing all concepts equally, the study guide focuses on cognitive load distinctions, which were clearly problematic based on the quiz responses. The explanations, analogies, and short practice activities are tailored to those gaps, while concepts the student already understands are largely left alone. This shows how AI can use evidence from student work to prioritize learning needs and generate a targeted study plan, something that is difficult to scale through traditional instruction alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a broader perspective, this result reflects a more balanced role for AI in learning. Rather than acting as a shortcut to answers, the AI functions as a post-assessment support tool that encourages reflection and re-engagement with course concepts. At the same time, the quality of the output depends heavily on how the prompt constrains the AI’s role. Without those constraints, the AI could easily default to giving direct answers. This suggests that AI’s impact on learning is less about the technology itself and more about how intentionally it is framed within the learning process.\n"
