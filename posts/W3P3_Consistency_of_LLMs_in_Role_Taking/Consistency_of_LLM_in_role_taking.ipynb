    "The water rose up, playful, lifting shells and placing them in my hands. It parted so I could walk among the coral and the creatures below. It was as if the ocean knew me‚Äîknew what I longed for, even before I did.\n",
    "That‚Äôs when it offered me the Heart of Te Fiti, the small green stone with the power to create life. I didn‚Äôt understand then why it chose me, or what it meant. But the ocean doesn‚Äôt make mistakes. It waits, patiently, until you‚Äôre ready.\n",
