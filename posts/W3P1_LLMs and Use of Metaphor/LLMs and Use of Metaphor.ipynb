    "In this week’s class we had a first glance at how LLMs are good at language and communication with humans in different scenarios and manners, but most of the examples we saw involved casual daily language. For example, when we talked about the word “bank” in class, there were many meanings associated with “bank” such as a financial institution, plane banking, or basketball bank shot, but they are still in common expressions. I am interested in whether LLM is good at language structures that add complexity in meaning, such as metaphors or idioms. \n"

It is also trained on a wide dataset, so anything that has long been published online would be easily searched through and recognized by LLMs. \n"
