    "Reading Superagency throughout this semester felt like having an ongoing conversation with the book rather than reaching a single conclusion at the end. Early on, I was genuinely convinced by the authors’ optimism. They frame AI as something that can increase human agency instead of replacing it, and they support this claim with many real examples. For instance, they describe AI tools used in mental health platforms and community-based applications, arguing that AI can scale care and support in ways humans alone cannot. At that point in the reading, I found myself agreeing with their argument that focusing only on AI’s risks can prevent us from seeing its potential benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I kept reading, though, my reaction became more mixed. A lot of the examples they use come from industry settings, such as professional platforms and data-driven tools connected to companies like LinkedIn. While these cases are persuasive, they also made me question who AI is really designed for. The authors often suggest that AI will broadly benefit society, but I struggled with this assumption. Not everyone has equal access to AI tools, and not everyone is equally represented in the data these systems are trained on. When the book discusses data as a resource for improving AI, it sometimes feels like it assumes that more data automatically leads to better outcomes, without fully addressing whose data is being used and who actually benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "One section that shifted my thinking was the discussion of how AI systems are tested and evaluated. Before reading Superagency, I tended to think of AI development as fast-moving and poorly controlled. The authors describe benchmarks, internal testing standards, and technical evaluations that developers use to measure performance and reduce errors. Learning about these practices made AI feel less chaotic and more like a system that is constantly being adjusted. While this did not erase my concerns about bias or misuse, it helped me see that AI development involves more intentional decision-making than I previously assumed."

    "Thinking of this function in application, I think it will help greatly on collaborative learning. One of the criticisms of AI for learning is that it only allows 1 on 1 interaction with AI. However, now with the collaboration function, AI can facilitate group dynamics. First of all, by having an AI facilitator, group projects can be done easier. One push back or frustration for students to complete group projects is that groups do not work efficiently when some people do not respond or when no one is willing to share inspiring ideas. AI chatbot can jump in group chats, prompt people and perhaps even provide fairer grading for group projects. For example, teacher may send a prompt to AI to have it evaluate students’ engagement. I am looking forward for prompt that makes use of collaboration in Chatgpt!"
